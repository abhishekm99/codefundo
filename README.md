#Disaster
One of the most dangerous disasters which cause great damages economocially as well as strategically and physcially are floods. Current system of predicting and prevensions against floods in India are not upto the mark which can be seen from the recent reports of floods in Kerela as well as every year in Mumbai and many other low lying regions.

#Prediction
Our team believes that the answer to solving these problems lies within machine learning and gathering data pertaining to this. In our Research we came across a GFMS system which was initialised by NASA, this system uses real-time TRMM Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) precipitation information as input to a quasi-global (50°N - 50°S) hydrological runoff and routing model running on a 1/8th degree latitude/longitude grid. Flood detection/intensity estimates are based on 13 years of retrospective model runs with TMPA input, with flood thresholds derived for each grid location using surface water storage statistics (95th percentile plus parameters related to basin hydrologic characteristics). Streamflow, surface water storage,inundation variables are also calculated at 1km resolution.In addition, the latest maps of instantaneous precipitation and totals from the last day, three days and seven days are displayed.

#Our plan
We plan to work on similar grounds but introduce more variables into the data set. We plan to use data such as amount of rainfall in the past 100 years each day of the monsoon season, land/soil composition and ability to hold moisutre, For cities such as Mumbai and other major towns we plan on further studying the composition of metal roads and pavements to detect as to how much depth of water shall cause a dangerous flood outbreak. 
#Preliminary Data
  1. Amount of rainfall
  2. Land composition
  3. Intensity of Rainfall
  4. Estimated period of rainfall
  5. Presence of natural methods to curb floods (Trees, excess soil which can absorb water).
  6. Presence of manmade methods such as manholes etc.
  7. Gradient of land.
  8. Water storage statisticcs.
  9. Presence of dams, canals, rivers etc.
  
The above are few of the important data sets which we feel shall help us in understanding the situation, our research is still at its preliminary stage and needs more work which we shall be providing to create a perfect Model.
Our system will corelate all these data and the machine learning algorithm shall judge on the basis of previous outcomes and other factors as to whether this region shall be flood prone in the current climate(Current amount of rainfall and future prediction for a 3 day period).

Our system shall only predict as to whether or not the area is prone to flood in the recent conditions, the system shall also take into account positions of nearby dams, lakes, rivers, canals which may or may not factor into the flooding of the city. We shall map out this data and move into our prevention module.

#Prevention
Currently based on speculation our prevention measures are still in their developing stages. We plan on mapping out data such as required amount of soil in an area, number of trees etc to curb water logging based on gradient of a land as well as other factors.
